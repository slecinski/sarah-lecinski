1. **PhD project highlight**

I investigated the role of macromolecular crowding (confinement effects) In the budding yeast _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_ during stress episodes such as osmotic stress and nutrient starvation. To monitor crowding in the cell I used a combination of molecular biosensors (FRET technology), confocal and Slimfield super-resolution light microscopy technique as physical tools.
I optimised a cellular model with yeast strains engineered for the controlled expression of trackable (down to single molecule level) fluorescently tagged cytoplasmic aggregates. To further understand the sub-celular spatial organisation during cell division and stress event.

I developed methodologies to understand cells' responses to environmental stress, macromolecular crowding dynamic and associated spatiotemporal events to ensure cell survival, such as the intracellular distribution of stress-induced aggregates. This comprehension is essential for biomedical purposes such as understanding factors influencing the distribution of pathological aggregates found in neurodegenerative disease. But also for pharmaceutical and industrial purposes, to understand and monitor the performance of synthetic circuits and their interaction with core metabolic processes in the cell. The homeostasis of the cells is disturbed by the accumulation and distribution of the exogenic compound (e.g pharmaceuticals, food additives) and developing new approaches to predict cell stress response spatiotemporal dynamics associated can ultimately permit the optimisation of practices for high-yield production.

2. **MSc project highlight**

I investigated the role of hydrophilic/hydrophobic interfaces on the formation of amyloid fibres using α-Synuclein as a model protein. The cells are an enclosed system with a delimiting membrane composed of lipids (hydrophobic species), while the interface is aqueous (hydrophilic) therefore forming a hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface _in vivo_. I used custom wells, built to create conditions with or without an air/water interface mimicking _in vitro_ a hydrophilic/hydrophobic interface.
I performed kinetics measurements (ThT binding) and used super-resolution microscopy (DSTROM and AFM) to access the dynamics of aggregation and the morphology of fibres produced according to conditions tested. 

α-Syn protein are responsible for Parkinson's disease where it is found to form amyloid fibres in the brain of ageing patients, a type of protein aggregate. These fibres accumulating in neurones are toxic and alternate cell functions. Insight on physical parameter influencing their formation have the potential to help health challenges currently facing to understand the mechanism causing the disease.
