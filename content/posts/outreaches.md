Public outreaches are activities I enjoy doing during py PhD ( see below),
I also present here access to couple of video games I adapted, a bit of a neardy hobby
But I can see a potential for public outreaches.

### :joystick: Video games 

I enjoyed learning to code for image analysis purpose.
With some notion of coding I had fun giving a try to video game programation.
All games are adapted from open-sourced video games,
All coded in Lua Language.

Game 1 : A custumised snake game, I coded the scoring system and changed graphics (using microscopic image of a yeast).
Game 2 : Phage/Bacteria Game and vice versa. Adapted from an "asteroid" game.
Game 3 : Flappy yeast - adapted from flappy bird, The bird became a yeast cell and pipes are Falcon tubes :)

It was fun to make!
