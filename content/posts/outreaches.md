Public outreaches are activities I enjoy doing during py PhD (see below),
I also present here access to couple of video games I adapted, a bit of a neardy hobby
But I can see a potential for public outreaches.

### :joystick: Video games 

I enjoyed learning to code for image analysis purpose. With some notion of coding I had fun giving a try to video game programation.

It was fun to make! You can find a descritive list below.

| Game-name              | Description |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| A snake game   | I coded the scoring system and changed graphics (using microscopic image of a yeast for the snake body) |
| Phage vs Bacteria | Adapted from an "asteroid" shooter game  |
|Flappy yeast| adapted from flappy bird, The bird became a yeast cell and pipes are Falcon tubes|

All games are adapted from open-sourced video games and coded in the Lua Language. 
[Availlable to try ](https://github.com/slecinski/Video-game/tree/main/windows%20executables) on my github.
