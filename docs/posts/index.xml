PhD project highlight I investigated the role of macromolecular crowding (confinement effects) In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during stress episodes such as osmotic stress and nutrient starvation. To monitor crowding in the cell I used a combination of molecular biosensors (FRET technology), confocal and Slimfield super-resolution light microscopy technique as physical tools. I optimised a cellular model with yeast strains engineered for the controlled expression of trackable (down to single molecule level) fluorescently tagged cytoplasmic aggregates.</description></item><item><title>Science outreach</title><link>https://sarah-lecinski.github.io/posts/outreaches/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sarah-lecinski.github.io/posts/outreaches/</guid><description>Public outreaches are activities I enjoy doing during py PhD ( see below), I also present here access to couple of video games I adapted, a bit of a neardy hobby But I can see a potential for public outreaches.
üïπÔ∏è Video games I enjoyed learning to code for image analysis purpose. With some notion of coding I had fun giving a try to video game programation. All games are adapted from open-sourced video games, All coded in Lua Language.</description></item></channel></rss>
